They are both really different experiences. I would recommend starting with the resident evil remake. The first one. Its a great game and you get to experience the original resident evil experience in modern consoles. Then you can try resident evil 0, and even emulate the old school ps1 games on your PC to play resident evil 2 and 3. If you want to experience the more action oriented games try resident evil 4 first, then 5. You can skip 6. These games make up the resident evil action trilogy. There is also resident evil Revelations 1 and 2 which are sort of spin offs but more a continuation of the story with over the shoulder action controls just like the original action trilogy. I wholeheartedly recommend the Revelations series since at least in my opinion have a little more horror in them while still being action. In terms of current generation games, resident evil went back to its horror roots. We have resident evil 7 and the remake of resident evil 2. Both are top tier games that I would definitely recommend. Im more a fan of the of survival horror resident evil. If I were to pick 3 games you absolutely need to play, itd be resident evil 1 remake, resident evil 2 remake, and resident evil 4.",welp two types resident evil games action ones survival horror ones really different experiences would recommend starting resident evil remake first one great game get experience original resident evil experience modern consoles try resident evil even emulate old school ps games pc play resident evil want experience action oriented games try resident evil first skip games make resident evil action trilogy also resident evil revelations sort spin offs continuation story shoulder action controls like original action trilogy wholeheartedly recommend revelations series since least opinion little horror still action terms current generation games resident evil went back horror roots resident evil remake resident evil top tier games would definitely recommend im fan survival horror resident evil pick games absolutely need play itd resident evil remake resident evil remake resident evil,-0.9958,-0.2521341463414634,0.6150406504065041,reddit,gaming

Digital doesnt offer that opportunity. Once you buy a game, then thats about it. Its yours so long as you never forget your account credentials. And as long your system doesnt break. Also if you regret a purchase or just dont like a game or get bored with it, then youre stuck with it and theres no refunds. So it depends on what you want.

But that is an exception to the rule. Typically it is just about creating a unique value that sets you apart from the crowd. Either you have uncommon skillsexperience or you have an unusually high proficiency at a common skill. If there are a lot of you, you dont have much value. If you are a rare specialist, then you have value. As an illustration, imagine that tomorrow you are gifted with Apple Corporation. You are now the very wealthy owner of the entire company. But your CEO is not too happy about it and he steps down. Also coincidentally, you need a cashier at an Apple Store at the Mall in Des Moines Iowa. Being the sole owner, you are free to set the wages for each position at whatever you like. Imagine the level of ease in finding someone capable of operating the cash register at the Apple store. Imagine how many applicants you would get. You would need to find someone trustworthy enough to handle thousands of dollars in merchandise every day and able to balance a cahs drawer. Now imagine how many applicants you get for the role of CEO. And how difficult it would be to select the person you want to steer a 1 TRILLION dollar company and be responsible for the jobs of tens of thousands of people globally. You are going to need someone that has leadership experience at the highest level. You are going to need someone familiar with trends, technology, legal. Implications, information privacy and security, diversification of revenue streams, comprehensive knowledge of competitors product lines, etc. There are probably less than 10 people in the world that you would consider for the role. And of those 10 people, all 10 of them are either employed or being actively courted by other megacorporations.

You forget that Steam comes with a lot of bonuses as well, like selling more copies due to the foothold Steam has. Steam also provides great servers so people can download their games and updates faster. The review system and rather large community where people can share and talk about the games. How many threads in the discussion forums for new games on Steam are about convince me to buy this game? As for devs selling games on their inhouse store, I have no problem with that and a lot of times they arent 100 exclusive. I dont like that exclusivity, but if they want to sell on only their launcher and limit their market, thats on them and they can make that choice. You also have to realize that a lot of the outrage is about developers pulling their game from Steam, after it was advertised there, not the games being Epic exclusive. Also if you look at things like their deals with Ubisoft, it isnt even about Epic building up their own store.

One time it gets heavily downvoted and the comments are full of no one is forcing you to play multiplayer, just play single player and there are plenty of single player games. Another is full of comments like this one where people talk about how it sucks there are more multiplayer games. I feel both are wrong and right. First off no one is forcing you to play multiplayer games, just because it has a tacked on multiplayer doesnt mean you have to play it. If there is a mechanic that forces multiplayer, its most likely a shitty game anyways. Secondly, there are more people in the gaming community that prefer multiplayer games to single player games. Why make a bunch of single player games when they arent going to sell as much as a multiplayer game? Plus there are a lot of really good single player games out right now, this meme has never been more irrelevant in the history of gaming. Maybe 10 years ago it would be more accurate, but right now its wrong. However, the multiplayer games that are out there now just havent really evolved at all. Once one comes out that is popular, 5 clones come out. It always feels like the top multiplayer games are just the same game trying to outdo the others but without stepping outside the template. People eat them up too, because the options are limited. They also breed micro transactions and loot boxes. And despite my earlier point some single player games do actually have tacked on multiplayer that is bad and takes away from the game slightly but usually its not forced on you, its just another option. It goes both ways though, most multiplayer games have a tacked on single player experience that is just as low quality. I dont think there is any Singleplayer vs Multiplayer going on here. Its greedy companies shitting out bad games vs companies that make good games. But we have the power to stop it, its very simple, if they stop making money they will stop making bad games.

Ultimate, the most entered game of EVO 2019 and head of the leaderboard for 2020 before it got cancelled, is no longer part of the list of games among the titles and is not shown at all in the trailer itself. gt;No reason was given for the change, but now the main event will focus on seven fighting games with Street Fighter 5: Champion Edition, Dragon Ball FighterZ, Samurai Shodown, Granblue Fantasy: Versus, Soul Calibur 6, Tekken 7 and Under Night InBirth Exe:Lateclr. gt;The tournament of champions bracket is still listed here as well, but Marvel vs. Capcom 2s logo is nowhere to be seen suggesting it is no longer part of the schedule as well.

But also, it makes sense to have certain protections. Like, you shouldnt be able to silence someone because you dont like their views or opinions. Which would include race, gender, sexual orientation, political affiliation, culture, age etc. I would even be fine with censoring certain topics as long as it is applied broadly. For instance, you could say no politics or religion in this forum, but you shouldnt be able to say No conservatives or Muslims. Or even if you wanted to make a forum for just one religion or political party, then make equal opportunity for other groups as well. You could have a sub reddit for conservative discussion and have one for liberal discussion. Have one for Christians, and one for Muslims, etc. It becomes a problem when a forum is sold as being broadly for the public like news then only allowing news that favors one group of people.

Theyre not. The moment that the PS4 Pro and the Xbox One X came out, the legacy systems were all but replaced. These new systems were already in the case of the One X about 6 times more powerful and they arrived during what was usually the time frame for a next gen console but just retained the names so people wouldnt think they were losing out. The difference between the legacy One and the One X was palpable during games like RDR2 and that games already two years old. Play the two back to back using unpatched launch versions and youll see a ton of issues albeit not to the scale of Cyberpunk but there was still enough prior to launch to force Rockstar to delay the release TWICE. The main difference here is the increased generational leap added yet another wrinkle because if the new gen version was nerfed to pacify the older consoles then you have yet another group of pissed off people screaming death threats and saying theyve been short changed after what was promised so you cant win. While theres a lot of blame on the shoulders of the company for misleading players up to launch, the plays also bare an equal share of the blame by stamping and screaming like spoilt brats when the multiple delays should have been a red flag that things werent right. It said in the first trailer that the game was out when its ready.

That can sometimes be called a tyranny of the majority. Lets say we get rid of Federal civil rights laws. And then your locality is ok with that too, so they decide to get rid of their local laws regarding equal access to public accommodations. Now, if your community supports that and if every voter made it to the polls, large groups of people would lose access to public accommodations: Do you think every voter should show up to the polls? Do you think if a rural Alabama town could get rid of civil rights protections for people of color, and they voted for that that all of those people of color should just move?

In the US there is a major problem with regulatory capture, where the regulatory agencies come to be dominated by the industries theyre meant to be controlling. Just to name a few look at Ajit pai, a telecoms lobbyist who now heads the FCC, Andrew Wheeler a coal lobbyist who heads the EPA, or Kailee Tkacz a lobbyist for the corn refiners association who is currently drafting the USDA nutritional guidelines. If you want to look specifically at enforcement try looking into the US bureau of prisons Special Investigative Services. A government report was compiled in 2019 which showed that misconduct was widespread and is often tolerated or ignored within the prison system. SIS has all the power they need to control misconduct from prison staff but they dont. Likely in part because they view themselves and the staff theyre meant to be investigating as part of the same system within the prison. I agree there is a need for change. The whole idea that if you nest enough layers of regulation you somehow get a system thats less corrupt seems flawed though. If anything it seems as though once the regulatory body itself becomes corrupt that behavior becomes normalized and spreads more quickly through those theyre meant to be overseeing. I just worry that its a specious approach to the problem which has been proven not to work again and again. Personally what Id advocate for is three fold. First I think we need to formalize officer training. Right now the situations in which it is acceptable or unacceptable to use differing degrees of force and how an officer is meant to approach any given situation is in no way standardized across different police academies even within the same state. Nor are many other aspects of police training. This leads to a huge variability in the quality of training officers receive and can have some perverse incentives. For example Safariland group has several training academies. Safariland also has several subsidiaries who produce basically every aspect of police equipment from bullet proof vests and gun holsters to K9 harnesses and tear gas. One of their subsidiaries is Defense Technology who produces many of the rubber bullets and their launchers that are being used right now, as well as selling gas canisters and every manner of pepper spray. By their own specification these tools are meant to be used on mildly resistive crowds. Not violent crowds or potentially dangerous crowds, just groups of people that meet some basic qualification for being mildly resistive. This policy was never reviewed by anyone, it was never considered by some state legislature. Yet its how officers are being taught to respond because weve made no attempts to standardize officer training. The people creating these weapons are also the ones telling people how they should use them. Second I think we need to seriously reevaluate what were using as measures when dictating police policy. For example in DC a push was made from two man police cars to one man cars. The one man cars were seen as superior as they required less manpower and made more arrests. They needed to call for help from other units more often but were still considered more efficient overall. You see this trend in a lot of places with law enforcement policy. More arrests or citations with less expense is always seen as the positive outcome for policing without really considering the context of those arrests or citations or the mental health of the officers working under differing conditions. This is a problem with many attempts to optimize like this. Consider if you had a population of red and blue bunnies, and you had the goal of optimizing the number of red bunnies. Well even though your goal theoretically has nothing to do with the number of blue bunnies youre inevitably going to neglect them population in the pursuit of breeding the most red bunnies you can. The same is true here. There is a very human element to police work and yet every administrative decision thats made seems to do its best to ignore it. This framing that police are there to make arrests and that more arrests is better also makes it so that officers are less likely to see their place as serving and improving their community and more as if they are there to catch people breaking laws no matter how petty or innocuous. Eventually you have to consider whats being optimized away with this decision making and if there isnt a better metric to be using. Police today dont consider themselves a part of many of the communities theyre meant to be protecting, and I dont think one decision is to blame for that, I think its the sum of a million smaller ones. Third and finally, I think we need to be willing and able to pursue radical change when necessary. Philadelphia for example convicted seven judges in a ticket fixing scandal and the state senate in response gave voters the opportunity to abolish their traffic court all together shortly afterward, which they voted to do. Now all further cases go to the municipal court. When evidence points to a large percentage of a cities police force being corrupt, abusive, or poorly trained we need out state legislators to step up. Right now so much of the focus is one the federal level and the city level but states have the power to rip out a lot of this corruption themselves. Now that its in the public spotlight its time to elect state legislators who are willing to take action as necessary and to lean on the ones who are already there to do something. A corrupt police precinct is not all powerful. Its just that those with the power to do something about it either arent aware of the problems or arent willing to pursue it.",also doesnt work variety industries us major problem regulatory capture regulatory agencies come dominated industries theyre meant controlling name look ajit pai telecoms lobbyist heads fcc andrew wheeler coal lobbyist heads epa kailee tkacz lobbyist corn refiners association currently drafting usda nutritional guidelines want look specifically enforcement try looking us bureau prisons special investigative services government report compiled showed misconduct widespread often tolerated ignored within prison system sis power need control misconduct prison staff dont likely part view staff theyre meant investigating part system within prison agree need change whole idea nest enough layers regulation somehow get system thats less corrupt seems flawed though anything seems though regulatory body becomes corrupt behavior becomes normalized spreads quickly theyre meant overseeing worry specious approach problem proven work personally id advocate three fold first think need formalize officer training right situations acceptable unacceptable use differing degrees force officer meant approach given situation way standardized across different police academies even within state many aspects police training leads huge variability quality training officers receive perverse incentives example safariland group several training academies safariland also several subsidiaries produce basically every aspect police equipment bullet proof vests gun holsters k harnesses tear gas one subsidiaries defense technology produces many rubber bullets launchers used right well selling gas canisters every manner pepper spray specification tools meant used mildly resistive crowds violent crowds potentially dangerous crowds groups people meet basic qualification mildly resistive policy never reviewed anyone never considered state legislature yet officers taught respond weve made attempts standardize officer training people creating weapons also ones telling people use second think need seriously reevaluate using measures dictating police policy example dc push made two man police cars one man cars one man cars seen superior required less manpower made arrests needed call help units often still considered efficient overall see trend lot places law enforcement policy arrests citations less expense always seen positive outcome policing without really considering context arrests citations mental health officers working differing conditions problem many attempts optimize like consider population red blue bunnies goal optimizing number red bunnies well even though goal theoretically nothing number blue bunnies youre inevitably going neglect population pursuit breeding red bunnies true human element police work yet every administrative decision thats made seems best ignore framing police make arrests arrests better also makes officers less likely see place serving improving community catch people breaking laws matter petty innocuous eventually consider whats optimized away decision making isnt better metric using police today dont consider part many communities theyre meant protecting dont think one decision blame think sum million smaller ones third finally think need willing able pursue radical change necessary philadelphia example convicted seven judges ticket fixing scandal state senate response gave voters opportunity abolish traffic court together shortly afterward voted cases go municipal court evidence points large percentage cities police force corrupt abusive poorly trained need state legislators step right much focus one federal level city level states power rip lot corruption public spotlight time elect state legislators willing take action necessary lean ones already something corrupt police precinct powerful power something either arent aware problems arent willing pursue,-0.9208,0.13567842041679254,0.47954570623175286,reddit,technology

In a traditional DDoS the attacker is trying to flood out some target server with so many requests that the host can no longer respond. The capability of this attack is limited by how much traffic the attacker can generate. With a DDoS amplification works by generating more traffic to that target than the attacker puts in. So the attacker might send a 32 byte request to a server with a vulnerability like this, and it might in turn send a 64 byte response to their desired target. As a result the attacker generates double the traffic they could have by just trying to spam messages to the target themselves. Consider it a little like if I told someone to Go through that folder with Alice. Its a short request but it would likely lead to both whoever I asked and Alice being tied up for a while. This attack is based on a similar principle. The device itself is not compromised, but is being used to amplify an attack. In this case a 4 byte message could lead to a 120 byte response as the device listed off its name, model, firmware version, IP addresses, MACs, and ESSID. Giving an amplification factor of 3035x. These devices tend to be installed in places capable of generating a large amount of traffic as well, and reports were suggesting that the vulnerability was actively being used in this kind of an amplification attack. However these attacks turned out to be a lot less meaningful than it first seemed. The devices do not allow multipacket responses, which severely limits how often they can be used to amplify an attack in this way. There were people attempting it all the same, but the only real effect was that it could make connecting to the device via SSH intermittent because of how frequently the attacker was making requests. Still they decided to release a patch anyway to shut it down. So crazy article headlines like Over 485,000 Ubiquiti devices vulnerable to new attack are just moronic. The device itself is not compromised, the amplification capability is pretty weak, its getting patched imminently, and its been known about since Jan. 29. Someone needs to smack the people who come up with headline like this.",headline annoys udp amplification attack traditional ddos attacker trying flood target server many requests host longer respond capability attack limited much traffic attacker generate ddos amplification works generating traffic target attacker puts attacker might send byte request server vulnerability like might turn send byte response desired target result attacker generates double traffic could trying spam messages target consider little like told someone go folder alice short request would likely lead whoever asked alice tied attack based similar principle device compromised used amplify attack case byte message could lead byte response device listed name model firmware version ip addresses macs essid giving amplification factor x devices tend installed places capable generating large amount traffic well reports suggesting vulnerability actively used kind amplification attack however attacks turned lot less meaningful first seemed devices allow multipacket responses severely limits often used amplify attack way people attempting real effect could make connecting device via ssh intermittent frequently attacker making requests still decided release patch anyway shut crazy article headlines like ubiquiti devices vulnerable new attack moronic device compromised amplification capability pretty weak getting patched imminently known since jan someone needs smack people come headline like,-0.9907,0.05411723050611939,0.48203195980973773,reddit,technology

I am sure someone else has posted how bad this movie is...but honestly after watching the movie I cant get over how bad the actual game is...SAO had issues as a fake game like dropdown menus, but Id rather be stuck in that game than even play the Oasis. If anyone can think of a worse fake game Id love to know cause I cant imagine it is possible. First issue, the actual gear. Just playing that game would end up killing so many people. In real life Pokemon Go got people to walk into traffic or fall off cliffs and the Oasis is even worse! Your actual body has to move like current real VR cause it is 2044 in a scifi movie. Spoiler the end battle of the movie they actually show people doing kicks and flips in the street. So not only is it extremely dangerous but real world skill is clearly needed to do stuff in the game. Imagine you are playing and see another do some flip or something, so you try it end up kicking your real TV and injuring yourself by falling cause you dont actually know how to flip. Second, the Easter Eggs. So getting the keys are shown as this hard thing no one can figure...yet they are things real gamers would do even if there were no keys! Spoiler...one is unlocked by driving backwards at the start of a race. Honestly feel like someone would try that for no actual reason within the first few attempts of the race. Specially considering a company is spending insane amounts of money trying to find and unlock these keys! It is like the writer just looked up gaming easter egg and used what popped up first. The last key is literally unlocked by knowing the first gaming easter egg ever. Third, progression and perma death. Not saying those are bad for games, but no way it would work in a game like that. Just imagine if you played WoW to the level cap and the second you die you have to start from lvl 1, only the most hardcore nitch gamers would even play it let alone invest much of their life into it. Again not saying a game wouldnt be made like this, but no way it would have the popularity of Oasis. Forth, little actual content. This might just be the affect of the movie, but it seems like the game itself has almost nothing to do besides the whole key thing. If this game was as big as it is there would be constant Battle Royales or impromptu races, yet seems like nothing in the Oasis exists unless it is somehow connected to the keys. Lastly, the player base itself is completely unrealistic. Due to the earlier mentioned perma death I cant imagine there isnt constant griefing! No way any high level avatar would exist for long cause some random troll would spend all their time trying to kill those players. Yet in this game everyone is way too chill...play like an hour of RDR online and you will get what I mean. As I said before, Id rather be trapped in a game with risk of real death then spend any money buying the gear to even play the Oasis.",oasis ready player one worst fake game evertldr oasis bad fake game felt need rant think horribly dumb almost insult gamers sure someone else posted bad movie isbut honestly watching movie cant get bad actual game issao issues fake game like dropdown menus id rather stuck game even play oasis anyone think worse fake game id love know cause cant imagine possible first issue actual gear playing game would end killing many people real life pokemon go got people walk traffic fall cliffs oasis even worse actual body move like current real vr cause scifi movie spoiler end battle movie actually show people kicks flips street extremely dangerous real world skill clearly needed stuff game imagine playing see another flip something try end kicking real tv injuring falling cause dont actually know flip second easter eggs getting keys shown hard thing one figureyet things real gamers would even keys spoilerone unlocked driving backwards start race honestly feel like someone would try actual reason within first attempts race specially considering company spending insane amounts money trying find unlock keys like writer looked gaming easter egg used popped first last key literally unlocked knowing first gaming easter egg ever third progression perma death saying bad games way would work game like imagine played wow level cap second die start lvl hardcore nitch gamers would even play let alone invest much life saying game wouldnt made like way would popularity oasis forth little actual content might affect movie seems like game almost nothing besides whole key thing game big would constant battle royales impromptu races yet seems like nothing oasis exists unless somehow connected keys lastly player base completely unrealistic due earlier mentioned perma death cant imagine isnt constant griefing way high level avatar would exist long cause random troll would spend time trying kill players yet game everyone way chillplay like hour rdr online get mean said id rather trapped game risk real death spend money buying gear even play oasis,-0.9938,-0.1348706643151088,0.48956153243190276,reddit,gaming

Dispersion could change hardness of edges or for a more smooth takeaway. Hell, maybe melting something into lava would then make the floor more dangerous?

Think Power Rangers and Kamen Rider for what I mean exactly. Combat would be like The Bouncer, where you can knock enemies into eachother to hurt them all and juggle them thanks to ragdoll physics. Team attacks would also be available, with each combination having a different move a la Chrono Trigger example: Red Blue would use a flapjackcutter combo, commonly known as the 3D, but Red Yellow might use a Magic Killer an aided snap swinging neckbreaker, while all 3 together would use a triple powerbomb. The heroes would also interact with the environment differently, with, for example, Blue just tossing a guy onto a car while Yellow would backflip off the car and over the mook. And of course, theyd each have their own weapons to further differentiate their playstyles. You wanna tank hits and smash stuff? Go Blue. Wanna be a flippy boi that does tons of damage fast in small increments? Play Yellow. If you feel like that one mook just needs a good kick in the teeth, pick Purple and start the superkick party! The world itself would be like InFamous, open with various separate districts so everything isnt just a generic Metropolis style cityscape. If you want to fast travel, you can take the subway, but if you feel like taking the long and pretty road, well, you can fly there! The mission structure would essentially open up a few side missions each time you clear a story mission, with rewards to give out like a wrestling DVD that inspires a new team attack or an accessory to wear thats gifted from a little kid you saved.",well ive got plenty ideas one genre feel isnt tapped enough games tokusatsu think power rangers kamen rider mean exactly combat would like bouncer knock enemies eachother hurt juggle thanks ragdoll physics team attacks would also available combination different move la chrono trigger example red blue would use flapjackcutter combo commonly known red yellow might use magic killer aided snap swinging neckbreaker together would use triple powerbomb heroes would also interact environment differently example blue tossing guy onto car yellow would backflip car mook course theyd weapons differentiate playstyles wanna tank hits smash stuff go blue wanna flippy boi tons damage fast small increments play yellow feel like one mook needs good kick teeth pick purple start superkick party world would like infamous open various separate districts everything isnt generic metropolis style cityscape want fast travel take subway feel like taking long pretty road well fly mission structure would essentially open side missions time clear story mission rewards give like wrestling dvd inspires new team attack accessory wear thats gifted little kid saved,0.9723,0.08532467532467532,0.44929653679653675,reddit,gaming

People including the one in question showed up to help protect the businesses. The kid in question was part of some sort of ROTC program or something and is a trained medic. Journalists ask him why he is there in the middle of a riot with a rifle. He says that they are just trying to protect the businesses and make sure everyone is safe. He shows them that he has a first aid kit and is offering first aid to anyone in need. As he is walking around yelling out Does anyone need medical, a couple of men attack him and try to take his gun from him. He backs away and tries to retreat. The journalists say that they hear gun shots and realize that bullets are flying in their direction toward the 17 year old... I cant remember his name... As the kid is trying to back up and get away, they keep coming at him. He raises his gun, they keep coming, and he shoots. It should be noted that all of the things that happened in the last bullet point happened in very quick succession. But it seemed pretty clear to me that he wasnt there trying to stir anything up. He was there to protect the car lot, along with several other guys that had been welcomed by the business owner. I guess my point is that call to arms to me implies that these guys were coming to the riots as an offensive measure. But from what I saw, they were clearly there for defense. No one got shot that didnt attack anyone, and there were several other men there with guns that didnt seize this opportunity to open fire. Im not saying that it was smart for this kid or anyone to open carry in the middle of a riot. Im just saying that it is being misrepresented. I believe anyone is justified in protecting their property. So when these businesses reached out for help from the community, its not really any different from hiring a voluntary security force.",watched videos shooting watched podcast journalists interviewed right happened seems situation extremely misrepresented key points took correct correct rioters destroyed local businesses several nights including car lots shattered windows jumped cars set fire people including one question showed help protect businesses kid question part sort rotc program something trained medic journalists ask middle riot rifle says trying protect businesses make sure everyone safe shows first aid kit offering first aid anyone need walking around yelling anyone need medical couple men attack try take gun backs away tries retreat journalists say hear gun shots realize bullets flying direction toward year old cant remember name kid trying back get away keep coming raises gun keep coming shoots noted things happened last bullet point happened quick succession seemed pretty clear wasnt trying stir anything protect car lot along several guys welcomed business owner guess point call arms implies guys coming riots offensive measure saw clearly defense one got shot didnt attack anyone several men guns didnt seize opportunity open fire im saying smart kid anyone open carry middle riot im saying misrepresented believe anyone justified protecting property businesses reached help community really different hiring voluntary security force,0.88,0.09361111111111112,0.3922486772486772,reddit,technology

I have one social media friend who is a black woman. She posts that she saw a little white girl who is her daughters classmate that had several small braids in her hair. She felt that this was stealing from her culture and she confronted the girls father about it. The post had an overwhelming number of comments of support mostly and assuring her that she did the right thing in confronting him. There were a lot of very negative comments about the dad and even some about the little girl. I have another social media friend who is a white man. His wife passed away several months ago after a long battle with cancer. He posts on social media that he is struggling to be a good single father to his three daughters. His wife would typically dress the girls, do their hair, etc. He was asking women what are the rules of hairstyles because he was confronted at school by a woman that told him braids were unacceptable for white girls. He said please help, braids are one of only two things I know how to do with the girls hair. He had an overwhelming number of comments and almost all of them were negative about the mom that confronted him. So in both cases, the social circles hear only one side of the story. And people rally with their pitchforks in support. But I just happened to have interactions with both parents, so I was able to witness this whole thing unfold from both sides. Had the mom been aware of the dads situation, Im certain she would have been more understanding. But because of social media, what should have been a misunderstanding between two people became a huge heated discussion among a lot of people that didnt know the full situation. And the disturbing thing was that, I posted on both of their posts. On the womans post, I said that I know the guy, he lost his wife, hes struggling to do the girls hair, and he had no idea that this would be offensive to anyone. And several women were so entrenched in this argument that they attacked me for being a sympathizer. They made comments that he should have been a more involved father when his wife was alive, that he should educate himself on black culture, that there is no excuse for cultural appropriation, etc. On the guys post, my comment was even less successful. I commented that the mom was not aware of his situation, that this is a sensitive subject for her because she has faced racism in her life, etc. And I got a lot of comments about how we are a melting pot, cultural appropriation is a stupid term, that the little girl wasnt trying to steal anyones culture, she just likes braids, etc. One interesting thing is that both threads ended up going political. People blamed Trump in both of them. And it should be noted that I live in a very diverse, very liberal neighborhood in CA. Almost all of these people are democrats. I know for a fact that the original mom and dad are both democrats but to their credits, they both went kind of quiet after my comments. So in then end, we had a little girl that wanted braids in her hair. And that ended up raising concerns that racist red hatters are invading our neighborhood. Some parents were wondering if they should move their kids to another school. This had nothing to do with politics whatsoever. As far as I can tell, no one was being racist. Not intentionally anyway And it ended up angering and dividing a huge bunch of people that normally would be very like minded. And all but two of them had absolutely no involvement in the situation. People are losing their minds every single day. And if it can get this bad among a bunch of people that love within a few blocks of each other. Imagine what is happening on Reddit when no one knows anyone and there are people posting on behalf of both political parties and people from foreign governments adding to the mix. When I hear only one side presented, I get immediately skeptical. Even if it supports my opinion. I wish other people would too. The vast, vast majority of people are good, well intentioned people that want the same core things. We just all have different opinions of how to get there. Instead of trying to fight some sort of civil war, we need to just work together. Conversate. Be polite. Learn from each other. You dont have to change your mind. They dont have to change their mind. But at least we will understand each other. Because no matter what side youre on, if you think that the other side is just trying to destroy the country, youre wrong. Both sides want peace and happiness for everyone. There are just nuances to what that actually means and how to achieve it.",give real life example im talking one social media friend black woman posts saw little white girl daughters classmate several small braids hair felt stealing culture confronted girls father post overwhelming number comments support mostly assuring right thing confronting lot negative comments dad even little girl another social media friend white man wife passed away several months ago long battle cancer posts social media struggling good single father three daughters wife would typically dress girls hair etc asking women rules hairstyles confronted school woman told braids unacceptable white girls said please help braids one two things know girls hair overwhelming number comments almost negative mom confronted cases social circles hear one side story people rally pitchforks support happened interactions parents able witness whole thing unfold sides mom aware dads situation im certain would understanding social media misunderstanding two people became huge heated discussion among lot people didnt know full situation disturbing thing posted posts womans post said know guy lost wife hes struggling girls hair idea would offensive anyone several women entrenched argument attacked sympathizer made comments involved father wife alive educate black culture excuse cultural appropriation etc guys post comment even less successful commented mom aware situation sensitive subject faced racism life etc got lot comments melting pot cultural appropriation stupid term little girl wasnt trying steal anyones culture likes braids etc one interesting thing threads ended going political people blamed trump noted live diverse liberal neighborhood ca almost people democrats know fact original mom dad democrats credits went kind quiet comments end little girl wanted braids hair ended raising concerns racist red hatters invading neighborhood parents wondering move kids another school nothing politics whatsoever far tell one racist intentionally anyway ended angering dividing huge bunch people normally would like minded two absolutely involvement situation people losing minds every single day get bad among bunch people love within blocks imagine happening reddit one knows anyone people posting behalf political parties people foreign governments adding mix hear one side presented get immediately skeptical even supports opinion wish people would vast vast majority people good well intentioned people want core things different opinions get instead trying fight sort civil war need work together conversate polite learn dont change mind dont change mind least understand matter side youre think side trying destroy country youre wrong sides want peace happiness everyone nuances actually means achieve,-0.9914,0.04956137731999802,0.4408702791461413,reddit,technology

Bad training or not, they are taught to stop the threat as it is happening. I am heavily against shooting someone in the back, but I am also against someone who will physically assault police and steal their weapons from escaping into my neighborhood. Im still not happy with this outcome at all, but where does this behavior stop? Should the rule be that if you can overpower the police officers arresting you for a legitimately dangerous offensedui, and you can run away from them with their weapons, back facing them, that they just have to stop and say oh well?

If youre expecting stories of the Valve gamemines where children are shackled to equipment and forced to eat their siblings for nourishment you arent really going to find it. They do have a habit of being pretty shitty to developers though and for a long time their refund policy was just brazenly illegal. People tend to forget or be unaware of just how hard Valve fought to avoid giving refunds, or when they tried to change their EULA to force everyone in the EU to wave their right to a reasonable refund on any purchase. Then when refunds were finally implemented the community reaction was akin to thinking Valve doing so out of the kindness of their heart. Not to avoid getting the pants sued off of them after losing multiple challenges in court. For developers they want the maximum share of the profit from games published on their platform, with the minimum possible responsibility or effort. These days valve just allows whatever shovelware to fill their platform, including games that are just asset flips, games which contain trojans, or even cryptocurrency mining software masquerading as a game. As of right now there is no way to ensure a game you purchase will even run as even that basic level of checking isnt done. Just look at how far AbstractismSilicon Echo Studios had to take it before community outrage finally went far enough to get valves attention. Similarly they do some pretty shady things with regional pricing. Essentially they present regional pricing as if it was just the currency conversion for a game in that region, but it isnt. In practice they will, often unknowingly to the developer, post the game in other regions for a massively discounted price. Sometimes as much as 60 less than the price in USD. Valve even lost a lawsuit for this practice in the EU as part of the EUs trade agreements require that the same goods be available with the same pricing through the EU. They essentially tried to argue that they knew better than the treaties these countries signed. The thing is Valve takes 30 from every sale made through their platform, and for a while they used to actually provide something worth that money. There were alternatives to Steam which you could publish your game through and use to handle updates which would only take about 5 from each sale. What that extra 25 represented was Steams customer base, and the fact that there was some minimum guarantee of quality. These days Steam does not curate and allows so much shovelware on their platform that theres functionally not much difference between trying to stand out in the massive crowd of all games on the internet and trying to stand out in the massive crowd of all games on steam. So as a small developer youre unlikely to see any advantage to publishing through them and as a large developer their costs seem outrageous. Hence why larger studios try to avoid publishing through steam and why Blizzard, EA, Ubisoft and every other major studio has their own platform. Combine that with their awful handling of customer reviews, and their unwillingness to give customers a dedicated place to report bugs or other technical issues, and it just makes for an aggressively bad platform to publish through. Yet because of their share of the industry you basically have to publish through them. Now as I started this by saying nothing here is all that bad and I do stand by that. More is a lot of smaller issues and issues in Valves response to them. Valve these days wants to sit back and let their games and their platform act as money printing machines which require the minimum possible human interaction. Just look at TF2. Years of no support and no community feedback but plenty of lootboxed cosmetics. Even as they screwed over the workshop artists who produce those assets by reducing their profit share to almost nothing. They do the minimum possible amount of work and squeeze anyone who publishes anything through them for every penny. They make money hand over fist and ultimately that revenue comes from somewhere. These days they even boast about their revenue per employee being much higher than pretty much any other large tech company. Over the years its added up to were many people are willing to migrate toward any reasonable alternative they can find.",ill say right upfront none bad youre expecting stories valve gamemines children shackled equipment forced eat siblings nourishment arent really going find habit pretty shitty developers though long time refund policy brazenly illegal people tend forget unaware hard valve fought avoid giving refunds tried change eula force everyone eu wave right reasonable refund purchase refunds finally implemented community reaction akin thinking valve kindness heart avoid getting pants sued losing multiple challenges court developers want maximum share profit games published platform minimum possible responsibility effort days valve allows whatever shovelware fill platform including games asset flips games contain trojans even cryptocurrency mining software masquerading game right way ensure game purchase even run even basic level checking isnt done look far abstractismsilicon echo studios take community outrage finally went far enough get valves attention similarly pretty shady things regional pricing essentially present regional pricing currency conversion game region isnt practice often unknowingly developer post game regions massively discounted price sometimes much less price usd valve even lost lawsuit practice eu part eus trade agreements require goods available pricing eu essentially tried argue knew better treaties countries signed thing valve takes every sale made platform used actually provide something worth money alternatives steam could publish game use handle updates would take sale extra represented steams customer base fact minimum guarantee quality days steam curate allows much shovelware platform theres functionally much difference trying stand massive crowd games internet trying stand massive crowd games steam small developer youre unlikely see advantage publishing large developer costs seem outrageous hence larger studios try avoid publishing steam blizzard ea ubisoft every major studio platform combine awful handling customer reviews unwillingness give customers dedicated place report bugs technical issues makes aggressively bad platform publish yet share industry basically publish started saying nothing bad stand lot smaller issues issues valves response valve days wants sit back let games platform act money printing machines require minimum possible human interaction look tf years support community feedback plenty lootboxed cosmetics even screwed workshop artists produce assets reducing profit share almost nothing minimum possible amount work squeeze anyone publishes anything every penny make money hand fist ultimately revenue comes somewhere days even boast revenue per employee much higher pretty much large tech company years added many people willing migrate toward reasonable alternative find,-0.6956,-0.03697525062656642,0.5213502506265666,reddit,gaming

Roy is the main character of FE 6, son of the hero of FE 7. He actually first appeared in Melee, before the game he starred in was released. Ike is the hero of the Tellius duology, Path Of Radiance and Radiant Dawn. He uses a zweihander called Ragnell as opposed to Marths Falchion sword and Roys Binding Blade. Lucina between Roy and Ike is Marths distant great granddaughter, who used his name as an alias for a time in Awakening on 3DS. She uses the same sword as him, just thousands of years older. Her father on the other side of Ike, is Chrom, prince of Ylisse. He also wields Falchion. Next is Robin, the avatar of Awakening. They are a Tactician class, giving them use of swords notably the magical Levin Sword and magic tomes Arcfire, Elwind, all levels of Thunder, and Nosferatu, which is normally only usable by Dark Mages as it is a dark tome. Female Robin can be seen holding a tome here. Next is Corrin, avatar of Fates, who was kidnapped as a youth by the king of Nohr from the Hoshido royal family, being forced to choose who to side with in the impending war as they have familial bonds with both sets of royal sublings. They have dragons blood, which in laymans terms means they can shapeshift via dragonstones and can terraform the land. Also their sword is a fucking chainsaw. Their male and female forms are the barefoot ones in white. And finally, there is Byleth, child of a noted mercenary and instructor at Garreg Mach Monastery, who in addition to their swordwhip, uses a legendary axe, bow, and lance in Smash. Byleth is the avatar of Three Houses, who after a timeskip is forced to choose which side to take between the three houses the same three they had to choose between when becoming a teacher, as well as the church of the religion of the land of Fodlan. Their male and female forms are the ones with the glowy orange swords and the all black armor and stockings in the female Byleths case.

As someone who has hated having money in all its various forms and been involved with Pokemon, MTG, and Android Netrunner. I have to say Netrunner as an LCG is just as fun to play, has the same kind of community honestly the netrunner community is better in many respects, and doesnt really lose anything by not relying on gambling to get cards. That said I really think there are three regulations which would allow both lootboxes and trading cards to exist in a much less predatory way. First probabilities and contents should be made easily available. You should know the vague contents going in. No hidden 1100000 chance of getting an unusual or something. Second all purchases should be of similar probabilistic distribution and value. So for MTG if every ten card booster contained one land, six common, two uncommon, and any rare. That would be fine, every pack is of equal probabilistic distribution and value. You cannot however make it so that one out of every 100 packs will contain an ultra rare mythical card within that regulation. Nor can you make it so that a lootbox might contain something ultra rare. Third these regulations should hold any time actual real world currency is involved in the process in any way outside of that initial purchase of the game. No This isnt gambling because youre using gems which can also be earned slowly by playing instead of through purchase. At the same time something like enemy drop rates or opening a chest in a game doesnt get regulated. Just exchanges which involve real world currency. In that way it would actually be a randomized reward, and not putting in a bunch of money and hoping to hit on something big.",personally id issue seeing fall regulatory framework someone hated money various forms involved pokemon mtg android netrunner say netrunner lcg fun play kind community honestly netrunner community better many respects doesnt really lose anything relying gambling get cards said really think three regulations would allow lootboxes trading cards exist much less predatory way first probabilities contents made easily available know vague contents going hidden chance getting unusual something second purchases similar probabilistic distribution value mtg every ten card booster contained one land six common two uncommon rare would fine every pack equal probabilistic distribution value cannot however make one every packs contain ultra rare mythical card within regulation make lootbox might contain something ultra rare third regulations hold time actual real world currency involved process way outside initial purchase game isnt gambling youre using gems also earned slowly playing instead purchase time something like enemy drop rates opening chest game doesnt get regulated exchanges involve real world currency way would actually randomized reward putting bunch money hoping hit something big,0.9322,0.08114035087719298,0.3817982456140352,reddit,gaming

Favorite part would have to be the career mode. I found Red and Tre to be great characters thanks to Bret Green and Kylie Browns acting, and yes, thats Kylie Brown of Life Is Strange fame, with a fun dynamic between them its very Kim Possible and Ron Stoppable esque, and personally speaking, as a bullying victim, theyre relateable. Brooklyn Von Braun is a consistent thorn in their sides starting from high school, where she embarrassed them for their WWE dreams and then assaulting Red, and she just got off scot free. Shes easy to hate with how she constantly touts how much better she is than Red and Tre and thanks to Barron Blade given Brooklyn Reds number its a persistent thing, not that he knew about their issues, and her blatant rule breaking that you hear about in her MMA career only 2 loses were DQs for eye gouging, not to mention turning an animal shelter into a tanning salon. Theres more, but its major spoilers. Coming in from SVR 11 on the Wii, busted as 2K20 is, its a breath of fresh air. Ive liked playing as these new people Im largely unfamiliar with like Rhea Ripley, Elias, Nikki Cross, and more in the DLC story towers, along with the Showcases that come with these fun DLCs that basically act as Elseworlds for the WWE Universe, where Bray Wyatt is a swamp monster trying to turn Finn Balor into the Demon King, and Seth The Wanderer is seeking to overthrow the Overlord Samoa Joe and free the people of the wasteland from his reign. Is it a GOTY? God no.

But Twitter is definitely worse and from my experience, Reddit is worse also. We like to blame it on the social media companies themselves, and they certainly have a large part in it because their algorithms push engagement and nothing engages people more than divisive, fringe politics. But the truth is that people are the main culprits. We have had people willing to spread bullshit forever. And we have had mindless sheep that believe everything they hear forever also. But social media gave those idiots a much larger voice. How many times have you seen a CNN article titled something like The internet is outraged over this thing that this celebrity said.? Then you go look at the actual tweet and 95 of the people commenting on it were fine with it. Then a handful of idiots took issue with it and thats who CNN writes about. So the result is that we give the reward of attention to the rare idiot that says the inflammatory thing instead of focusing on the majority of people that can have civil discourse and form their own opinions. Also, the information keeps changing. Covid19 is a great example. The WHO told us that masks dont benefit the public and not to wear them. Then they said everyone should wear them. They told us to shut down the economy, then recently said that they are against shutdowns except in extreme circumstances. I understand that information is developing and always changing. But the scientists that were saying these things first, were considered misinformation. And now they are proven accurate. So often times the appeal to bias even creeps into our judgment of what is misinformation. How can we hold the social media companies accountable for misinformation when experts cant even agree one what is accurate, and when the social media platform is made up of average people talking out of their ass?",facebook common scapegoat twitter definitely worse experience reddit worse also like blame social media companies certainly large part algorithms push engagement nothing engages people divisive fringe politics truth people main culprits people willing spread bullshit forever mindless sheep believe everything hear forever also social media gave idiots much larger voice many times seen cnn article titled something like internet outraged thing celebrity said go look actual tweet people commenting fine handful idiots took issue thats cnn writes result give reward attention rare idiot says inflammatory thing instead focusing majority people civil discourse form opinions also information keeps changing covid great example told us masks dont benefit public wear said everyone wear told us shut economy recently said shutdowns except extreme circumstances understand information developing always changing scientists saying things first considered misinformation proven accurate often times appeal bias even creeps judgment misinformation hold social media companies accountable misinformation experts cant even agree one accurate social media platform made average people talking ass,-0.9791,0.0035838293650793706,0.5220486111111111,reddit,technology

But the rise of special interest groups is a result of our population being so enormous and diverse. So the issues that I value in CA are not the same issues that people value in Illinois just a random example. And even among the same neighborhoods, people cant agree on what is best for the community. So its really tough to form one group that would represent the best interests of the country. I think the most effective way would be for us citizens to stop paying attention to Rs and Ds and instead vote on issues.

I remember seeing on screen polls that added up to more than 100. Stuff like that. But lately they seem better. This morning I listened to WaPos live coverage of the impeachment hearings on YouTube. I dont know if you listened to the hearings or not, but it was not a good look for the democrats questioning the witnesses. It was a lot of grandstanding, speaking to the audience with highly editorial monologues. A few of the Republicans later in the session did the same thing. But when it came to facts about illegal or impeachable offenses, they were striking out. The Republicans got the witnesses to say that the request was not unprecedented, not illegal, and not impeachable, but that it didnt feel ethical. Then the democrats responded by talking about how the witness had an immigrant father, had a strong service record, etc. They were grasping at straws. It was pretty disappointing. Then when the session was over, they threw it back to the WaPo studio where they were basically taking a victory lap. They didnt address any of the most relevant statements and instead offered editorials about republican strategy. And this happened after I made the above post about WaPo. I was shocked that they had such a blindspot. But based on what Ive heard so far, Trump will 100 not be removed from office, and all of the people that listen to WaPo and other media outlets like that are going to lose faith in our government and the systems in place. They are going to be shocked just like they were when Hillary lost. Im not saying that WaPo is not useful. Im just saying that they dont present the whole picture. And Fox News does the same thing.

Men are arrested much more frequently than women, but that in itself doesnt mean its sexism. Its very possible that men commit more crime than women do. And as a man, Im sure thats the case. Also the correlation is strong between poverty and crime. And seeing that minorities are disproportionately poor, that alone would contribute to more black crime than white crime. I dont doubt that black people are arrested more frequently. All the data supports it. But that doesnt mean that police are racist. It may just mean that there are more poor, desperate, black people statistically from worse school systems and as such are more prone to crime.

If youre looking for advice from player testing, I think the 2 areas this game needs the most work in is powerups and block dropping. I noticed that when the highest number increases it wipes out all blocks of a certain number, which is a really nice mechanic, but leaves me wanting more abilities like that. It gets really difficult towards the end, and having abilies that assist in clearing blocks would help a lot and make it feel like Im actually progressing. Then on the same lines of getting difficult towards the end, the number of blocks that drop are way too high towards the end. Maybe the current mechanic could be used in some sort of time trial mode where it makes sense that the game would get incredibly difficult in a short period of time, but for a casual almost 2048 feeling game, I dont like that I can go from only having 5 blocks on my board to losing in just a few rounds. I think abilitiespowerups could help with this, and maybe you could implement something where every destroyed block gets rid of one of the ones that were gonna fall or something like that. I just want to feel like I have more control than having to wipe out 15 blocks each round just to not instantly lose. But dont take my critique to mean I dont enjoy it.

The game was originally supposed to be about exploration. In the demos and whatnot before release, they made a big point about zooming out in the galaxy map and saying stuff like Everyone of these dots of light is a star with its own unique planets. Most of them will probably never be visited. Thats the potential I think people were excited about. Sure, since release theyve added base building, vehicles, freighters, VR, mission boards, etc. But theyve still never really fixed the major complaint people always had about the game: once youve played for a few hours youve seen it all, pretty much. There are like six or eight planet archetypes and all planets of a given archetype look almost identical. There are exotic biomes thrown in, but again, theres a handful of those and all planets of a given type look the same. If youve seen one bubble planet youve seen them all. In short, you could pick out a star cluster of like a dozen stars and you could see literally everything the game has to offer without leaving that cluster. So whats the point of 18 quintillion stars? Its received a lot of positive press over how much its improved, but really most of the content theyve added just serves to distract you from the games core problem. And some of the new content, such as space encounters, is implemented in an insultingly halfassed manner.",still wide ocean deep puddle game originally supposed exploration demos whatnot release made big point zooming galaxy map saying stuff like everyone dots light star unique planets probably never visited thats potential think people excited sure since release theyve added base building vehicles freighters vr mission boards etc theyve still never really fixed major complaint people always game youve played hours youve seen pretty much like six eight planet archetypes planets given archetype look almost identical exotic biomes thrown theres handful planets given type look youve seen one bubble planet youve seen short could pick star cluster like dozen stars could see literally everything game offer without leaving cluster whats point quintillion stars received lot positive press much improved really content theyve added serves distract games core problem new content space encounters implemented insultingly halfassed manner,0.9682,0.03713343108504398,0.5456093189964157,reddit,gaming

A megacorporation that has their fingers in basically every pie from real estate to military arms dealing has reverse engineered alien tech to create the newest advancement in offensive peacepreserving measures which of course would be the transformation devices. On a class science trip to the building containing the tech, the Big Guy in the heroes clique suggests they sneak off to grab looks at something confidential that caught his eye. Naturally, this is the incendiary incident that leads to our heroes getting their hands on the transformers, as theyre dragged along with him trying to get him back to the class before being kicked out of the building. After the discovery that a bunch of their highly valuable tech has gone awol, the megacorps big shots the villains send some of their security droids to take them back, leading to our tutorial sequence, explaining how each characters melee and ranged attacks work, team attacks, unique abilities, etc.. Later on, a crime in progress is halted by the leader of the clique, which they discover has some connection to the megacorp, leading to the meddling teenagers with attitude deciding to stop whatever greater machination that the villains are planning. The game would be an open world beatemup with RPG elements and a missionbased structure, kind of like InFamous. Each mission would basically be an episode. Experience would be gained from either combat against enemies or training with the team, and skill points would be spent on upgrading attributes of attacks and learning new ones which can be made available to acquire either by seeing them performed e.g.: You could learn a hurricanrana for the smaller members of the team, or have two of them perform Celebrity Rehab by watching a wrestling match on TV, or by thinking of them in a brainstorming session.

It is very difficult to turn it around once players start leaving. If I were a betting man, I would say they just bit off more than they can chew.

Basically the story is that Doom Guy was stationed at Marss moon Phobos for getting into an argument with his superior officer, and he just happened to be there when the demons invaded after something happened with the teleporters to Deimos. Eventually he goes to Deimos, now in Hell, to finish the job. But then the sequel happens, and he has to go back to Earth to fight the demons there, which is where he discovers they killed Daisy. He helps humanity escape the Earth, but then he has to destroy a force field so they can actually get away, then decides to go back to Hell, and essentially destroy it so the demons cant invade again, and the damned have nowhere to go upon death. Fast forward to Doom 64: The Absolution, and the demons are back on the moon bases. He heads back to slaughter them all with gusto, and decides to pull the Youre locked in here with me card, for ALL OF HELL to make absolutely sure they dont invade again. Which may or may not lead into the backstory of DOOM 2016. This Classic Doom Guy is the son of Commander Keen and greatgrandson of BJ Blazkowicz. Now we come to 2016, where the Doom Slayer wakes up in the UAC facility without armor after being pulled from a sarcophagus that the demons managed to seal him in after eons of him fucking them in the ass. Turns out Olivia Pierce orchestrated a demonic invasion of the facility because she wanted power beyond cornering the market on Argent Energy. And The Doom Slayers like a last resort in case messing with Hell went wrong and naturally it does. So youre fighting your way through Mars and Hell and back again, and along the way you picked up this fancy energy sword hilt called The Crucible. Samuel Hayden, 130 year old man in a robot body whos basically your mission control decides to take it from you after you kill Olivia and boot you back to Hell, because the Argent Energy is apparently solving an energy crisis that Hayden says is otherwise unsolvable. AND THAT IS WHAT CAUSES ETERNAL. What I didnt tell you about is Doom 3 because thats largely standalone, and VFR because this is long enough as is and doesnt focus on Doom Guy or Slayer.",eternal really basically story doom guy stationed marss moon phobos getting argument superior officer happened demons invaded something happened teleporters deimos eventually goes deimos hell finish job sequel happens go back earth fight demons discovers killed daisy helps humanity escape earth destroy force field actually get away decides go back hell essentially destroy demons cant invade damned nowhere go upon death fast forward doom absolution demons back moon bases heads back slaughter gusto decides pull youre locked card hell make absolutely sure dont invade may may lead backstory doom classic doom guy son commander keen greatgrandson bj blazkowicz come doom slayer wakes uac facility without armor pulled sarcophagus demons managed seal eons fucking ass turns olivia pierce orchestrated demonic invasion facility wanted power beyond cornering market argent energy doom slayers like last resort case messing hell went wrong naturally youre fighting way mars hell back along way picked fancy energy sword hilt called crucible samuel hayden year old man robot body whos basically mission control decides take kill olivia boot back hell argent energy apparently solving energy crisis hayden says otherwise unsolvable causes eternal didnt tell doom thats largely standalone vfr long enough doesnt focus doom guy slayer,-0.9982,0.0036796536796536734,0.27730880230880234,reddit,gaming

I think its worth discussing each of them individually rather than making broad statements about EA or the studios themselves since a lot of what youve said here also isnt really the case. Bioware and Pandemic in particular make for an interesting discussion. Bioware and Pandemic are listed separately here but really theyre a part of the same acquisition. Its one of the more difficult ones to describe because there is a lot going on behind the scenes. Really it starts with the private equity firm Elevation Partners. Recently established the firm had capital but no actual investments as of yet. Among the members of their board was John Riccitielli. Riccitielli left a position as CEO of EA to cofound Elevation Partners. Shortly there after the firm attempted to acquire Eidos Interactive from shareholders. The board of Eidos suggested that shareholders accept a bid of 0.88 per share for a total of about 126 million at that time. That deal never went through though as another equity firm, SCi Entertainment, stepped in and made it into a bidding war offering 1.29 a share. Still possessing a large amount of capital and wanting a stake in the Games industry Elevation Partners started to support a merger between Bioware and Pandemic by promising 300,000 in venture capital. The deal promised an independence from the system of selling to publishers and seems to have been presented as being a similar to the arrangement Steve Jobs had with Pixar where their creative freedom would not be infringed. At that time the CEO of Bioware Ray Muzyka had this to say: BioWare and Pandemic will use our new alliance as a launch pad for exchanging creative ideas, cutting edge technologies and top talent while retaining our distinctive cultures. In a business where developers often must sell out to survive, this deal is refreshingly new: a partnership of equals. The two companies were afterward jointly owned by VG Holdings Corp video games holding corporation. It was during this time that Pandemic studios released both installments in the Destroy All Humans franchise and the funding was likely directly responsible for Bioware being able to release the first installment in the Mass Effect Series. The cofounders of Bioware and the cofounders of Pandemic were now shareholders and Riccitielli was made CEO. in 2007 Riccitielli returned as CEO of EA and EA acquired VG holdings from elevation partners for 620 million. Riccitielli himself made 4.9 million in the acquisition. Pandemic clearly struggled under EA. A situation which is pretty clear in how EA began distributing their licenses and IP to other developers. Mercenaries 2 for example was developed in partner with Artificial Mind amp; Movement Inc. a studio which at that time specialized in shoveling out games based on movies and tv. shows for rapid release. Pandemic studios was eventually closed under the terms of their original contract. Bioware remains in part due to the runaway success of the mass effect series. Some of the companies in that list are just examples of struggling studios without the funds to make it from release to release, others though are quite interesting if you look into them.",always theres lot nuance kinds situations ever presented think worth discussing individually rather making broad statements ea studios since lot youve said also isnt really case bioware pandemic particular make interesting discussion bioware pandemic listed separately really theyre part acquisition one difficult ones describe lot going behind scenes really starts private equity firm elevation partners recently established firm capital actual investments yet among members board john riccitielli riccitielli left position ceo ea cofound elevation partners shortly firm attempted acquire eidos interactive shareholders board eidos suggested shareholders accept bid per share total million time deal never went though another equity firm sci entertainment stepped made bidding war offering share still possessing large amount capital wanting stake games industry elevation partners started support merger bioware pandemic promising venture capital deal promised independence system selling publishers seems presented similar arrangement steve jobs pixar creative freedom would infringed time ceo bioware ray muzyka say bioware pandemic use new alliance launch pad exchanging creative ideas cutting edge technologies top talent retaining distinctive cultures business developers often must sell survive deal refreshingly new partnership equals two companies afterward jointly owned vg holdings corp video games holding corporation time pandemic studios released installments destroy humans franchise funding likely directly responsible bioware able release first installment mass effect series cofounders bioware cofounders pandemic shareholders riccitielli made ceo riccitielli returned ceo ea ea acquired vg holdings elevation partners million riccitielli made million acquisition pandemic clearly struggled ea situation pretty clear ea began distributing licenses ip developers mercenaries example developed partner artificial mind amp movement inc studio time specialized shoveling games based movies tv shows rapid release pandemic studios eventually closed terms original contract bioware remains part due runaway success mass effect series companies list examples struggling studios without funds make release release others though quite interesting look,0.9921,0.08419124278499279,0.4533019931457432,reddit,gaming

Someone who plays games like Hearthstone, Overwatch, DotA2, and League of Legends is obviously a PC gamer. They might play more than most other people even. They also are playing a fairly modern game, with an active community. However they dont really have a need for increased ram, and would be unlikely to see any benefit from it. Someone who plays a lot of indie titles could similarly be playing a lot of fairly modern games and never see the benefit in getting more ram. Indie studios just typically dont have the resources to invest in large graphically intensive experiences. As a result they usually either rely on a stylistic appeal or have an appearance that seems several generations behind. Someone in this community could similarly play and own a ton of games, all recent releases and never see much benefit in additional ram. Really the largest group that benefits from 8gb of memory tends to be triple A gaming. Outside of that there are plenty of games which can be enjoyed which will never require more than a few Gb of memory. Personally speaking Ive managed to make due with an old computer and 6Gb of memory up until X4 Foundations came along. I never really felt like it was limiting either, part of that though is that Ive never been all that invested in the big studio releases. Now times are changing, 8Gb is these days just what people put in their minimum specs by default. I just think a lot of people seem to have this idea in their head of what gaming is and are kind of blind to others experiences.",think part issue leading lot conflicting opinions comments gaming really wide set things communities isolate enough theyre able somewhat ignorant one another someone plays games like hearthstone overwatch dota league legends obviously pc gamer might play people even also playing fairly modern game active community however dont really need increased ram would unlikely see benefit someone plays lot indie titles could similarly playing lot fairly modern games never see benefit getting ram indie studios typically dont resources invest large graphically intensive experiences result usually either rely stylistic appeal appearance seems several generations behind someone community could similarly play ton games recent releases never see much benefit additional ram really largest group benefits gb memory tends triple gaming outside plenty games enjoyed never require gb memory personally speaking ive managed make due old computer gb memory x foundations came along never really felt like limiting either part though ive never invested big studio releases times changing gb days people put minimum specs default think lot people seem idea head gaming kind blind others experiences,0.9744,0.06254826254826253,0.3897361647361647,reddit,gaming

If done well, it can add to the challenge and even change your playstyle take Darksiders on Apocalyptic for example, you want to be much more evasive and less facetanky, in addition to wanting your health up as much as possible, but all in all I think that to add it to every 4th new release would be overkill.

People talk about returning to a time when the US led the world in innovation and had the largest economy on the planet. Its definitley not fascism to aspire to regain touch with past successes. That slogan wasnt selected as some sort of fascist battle cry. It was carefully crafted by political bean counters to make a slogan that every American would agree with. And no one predicted that Make America Great Again would be seen as offensive. And as for the wall thing, even Hillary advocated for building walls on the border.

Mainly because of how your team gains experience and abilities. In UFO Defense a high level soldier was a bit more accurate, panicked less easily, and could go further. They werent actually all that much better than rookies though. So while you could much more easily get squad wiped out of the blue, at one point I even remember reaction fire from a stun bomb wiping out everyone inside the skyranger on the first move of the round, that didnt mean it was automatically over. There was this sense after a bad mission of Youve failed, you must continue. Which was really fun. With the newer XCom games I feel like losing some key team members at certain points just means the game is lost, especially XCom 2 where it keeps you constantly on a timer through every mission forcing you to push ahead. The game is in some sense balanced around you having certain abilities. Getting wiped out is often, though not always, a death sentence. I really like the new games, and I think theyve improved on the formula in a lot of ways. The soldier abilities and scaling means that theyre all much more memorable. With the classic and higher difficulties though this shows the most. It feels like theyve ramped up the challenge but also lost a lot of what made that kind of difficulty justified or fun in the first place. Im not really sure that a perfect solution exists for this one though.",eh bit rant really feel like something later versions xcom kind lost original mainly team gains experience abilities ufo defense high level soldier bit accurate panicked less easily could go werent actually much better rookies though could much easily get squad wiped blue one point even remember reaction fire stun bomb wiping everyone inside skyranger first move round didnt mean automatically sense bad mission youve failed must continue really fun newer xcom games feel like losing key team members certain points means game lost especially xcom keeps constantly timer every mission forcing push ahead game sense balanced around certain abilities getting wiped often though always death sentence really like new games think theyve improved formula lot ways soldier abilities scaling means theyre much memorable classic higher difficulties though shows feels like theyve ramped challenge also lost lot made kind difficulty justified fun first place im really sure perfect solution exists one though,0.9828,0.16954210472067618,0.516598209991067,reddit,gaming

Besides throwing cans Which might end up alerting the whole group of enemies you want to sneak past, it provides zero stealth systems. Some enemies seem to have ultra instinct and see you through walls, others wont see you or hear you if youre standing right behind them, despite your gear being shiny and your gasmask sounding like a low battery smoke alarm. And then the absurdity of putting 20 bullets in someones head. Or having almost endless lines of banter for every character on every location at every point Anna has like 300 recorded dialogue lines in the train, yet Artyom speaks only in loadscreens. I get it, the game doesnt hold your hand, you cant teleport or roflstomp everything without consequence... But it should actually reward you for doing otherwise. Do I really care if I just Jenkins my way through and everyone ends up dead in the end? Why should I? Its not like losing Duke and Random Mongolian has any effect. And then they give you this kickass crossbow, and tell you Hey, Artyom blyat, this crossbow is good suka, you can shoot people right in the huy with it, but youre expected not to kill anyone with it or else your friend with the random russian name Forgot already, Vasily?

But I think they could be a good idea for just about any business, if they changed their structure a little. Some unions are great. Police, fire, and teacher unions seem to be on the right track. But what Ive seen with unions like the UAW is that they fight against the company. Its never good to have the company fighting for all they can get and union fighting for all they can get because it puts them at odds. And they both need each other to survive.

A lot of the time that money goes to the publisher, while the developers still get paid what they get paid regardless. Those situations it wasnt even the developers choice there, so now they get hit with bad flak and customers get their choice of store removed. Adding on to that you have self published games, Phoenix Point being a perfect example of this going completely wrong. The game was crowd funded, with a Steam release as a stated part of the deal. After the game got pretty far into development due to the people backing it, they essentially sold the game to Epic in an exclusivity deal, then told the people that made the game possible in the first place, If you dont like it go ahead and refund, we made enough money off this deal that it doesnt matter. Boy I sure am glad that this is good for developers. Because they are the ones I care about, not myself. And that really sums up the core of it for me. People keep talking about whats better for the developers again, usually publishers while dismissing any argument about whats better for the consumer. I dont care about whats good for developers I mean, I dont want things to be bad for them, I care about whats good for me when Im buying a product. And buying a game I want on a platform I dont want isnt whats good for me. gt;People call steam a monopoly because despite there being other options they control like 75 of the market. Which is very specifically not a monopoly. People call Steam a monopoly because the word has a negative connotation and thats the narrative Tim Sweeney pushes. Youll notice how they didnt come out with, Epic games takes only 12 of revenue compared to industry standard 30. They specifically went after Steam, trying to make them look like the bad guy. Steam has done so much for the PC community Photon, letting devs give Steam keys with games they sell privately, while having by far the most feature complete store and library system out there while they still charged the standard fee for hosting games on what is to me the best set of servers I have personally used way better download speeds from Steam than anywhere else. Maybe the reason Steam controls like 75 of the market is because they essentially came first and then continued to improve and update so the market stayed with them. I want to finish by saying that I know Steam Valve is by no means perfect and they have had their share of problems in the past. I dont mean to come off as holding them up on some pillar, I would say GoG comes closer to being the ones that should get that with their DRM free policy. But I cannot stand people that defend Epic as doing something remotely good, and since it almost always comes at the expense of bashing Steam, thats who I end up defending in these discussions.",big issue often times isnt always better developer lot time money goes publisher developers still get paid get paid regardless situations wasnt even developers choice get hit bad flak customers get choice store removed adding self published games phoenix point perfect example going completely wrong game crowd funded steam release stated part deal game got pretty far development due people backing essentially sold game epic exclusivity deal told people made game possible first place dont like go ahead refund made enough money deal doesnt matter boy sure glad good developers ones care really sums core people keep talking whats better developers usually publishers dismissing argument whats better consumer dont care whats good developers mean dont want things bad care whats good im buying product buying game want platform dont want isnt whats good gtpeople call steam monopoly despite options control like market specifically monopoly people call steam monopoly word negative connotation thats narrative tim sweeney pushes youll notice didnt come epic games takes revenue compared industry standard specifically went steam trying make look like bad guy steam done much pc community photon letting devs give steam keys games sell privately far feature complete store library system still charged standard fee hosting games best set servers personally used way better download speeds steam anywhere else maybe reason steam controls like market essentially came first continued improve update market stayed want finish saying know steam valve means perfect share problems past dont mean come holding pillar would say gog comes closer ones get drm free policy cannot stand people defend epic something remotely good since almost always comes expense bashing steam thats end defending discussions,0.7389,0.1125,0.5232510288065844,reddit,gaming

But nothing I have seen has made me stop and think, Wow, this game that was supposed to release four years ago is blowing my mind. A lot of what Ive seen admittedly I stopped really keeping up with it a while ago, but still follow the big points just seems to be stuff thats tacked on for the sake of showing how great it is. A perfect example of this is and this was one of the early points of the game something like the ships being 100 physics simulated, with each thruster point being simulated and things like the fuel lines in the ship being real. I think thats super cool, but when it comes down to it, they could just fake all that with much simpler systems and you would never know. There comes a point in the development of games, especially a crowd funded game, where you have to weigh the benefits of spending years developing systems that people wouldnt really notice to begin with.",well ill start saying dont want get wrong really hope game comes incredible work art nothing seen made stop think wow game supposed release four years ago blowing mind lot ive seen admittedly stopped really keeping ago still follow big points seems stuff thats tacked sake showing great perfect example one early points game something like ships physics simulated thruster point simulated things like fuel lines ship real think thats super cool comes could fake much simpler systems would never know comes point development games especially crowd funded game weigh benefits spending years developing systems people wouldnt really notice begin,0.9722,0.08703703703703705,0.5359788359788359,reddit,gaming

They are kind of copying the Pixel 3a approach of giving a great performing budget phone in exchange for some niceties that the flagship has.

I dont mind phones getting bigger like they have, but I can definitely understand people that prefer them smaller. However, with this phone being so small, it seems critical that the real estate is maximized with as much screen as possible. But they went with a smaller phone and a smaller screen. Almost no phones on the market have these huge bezels regardless of price point. So even though I know this phone is a performer. I cant get past it looking like a 5 year old phone and offering such a small screen. The processor and camera are great! But looking at this tiny screen would make me hate the phone. The edge to edge screens that we have become accustomed to are like high speed internet. Its really hard to go back to dial up. And its hard to go back to crappy screens. ... and it is crappy. Its not just small, its poor resolution, poor refresh rate, and its so dim you cant see it outdoors even on full brightness.

They dont control prices publishers do, and they dont prevent selling at other stores, so the dangers of a monopoly are also not really present. As for Phoenix Point I wasnt holding Epic morally responsible, I was putting the blame on Julian Gollop and crew. They are the ones that ultimately made the very anticonsumer choice of money over fulfilling backer promises and removing choice of market. That being said, Epic is at the very least responsible for creating an offer too good to refuse. Hey, heres so much money you can literally tell all your backers to refund and youll still be in the black. So while I blame JG for taking the deal, Epic is still somewhat responsible for the situation. gt;I do believe steam could use a little competition. Which is great, I think so too. And some places have been offering decent competition, GoG being the biggest contender there. But what Epic is doing isnt strictly competing before you google what is competition in capitalism please understand that I mean competing by providing a competitive service for the consumer, not competing like they are in competition technically.

What if I told you that men have as much control over their crying as women do? Would you argue that women should stop crying and make themselves useful during a stressful event? Would you demand that men cry more? Would you acknowledge that men typically dont cry as readily as women so it would be as cruel to demand that men cry as much as as women do? And to what end are men to cry? To normalize womens crying because gender is a social construct? How about we accept that men dont cry because they are just less likely to cry and its only troublesome to feminist theory and the occasional men who do cry because they are the ones who are hurt by the expectation that they behave like emotionally typical men. Note also that it doesnt talk about sadness which men feel as readily as anyone else but the act of crying to prove your sadness which is a bridge too far for most men.,assumption men want cry cant cry social pressures crying involuntary action due emotional stimulus tears flow whether want told men much control crying women would argue women stop crying make useful stressful event would demand men cry would acknowledge men typically dont cry readily women would cruel demand men cry much women end men cry normalize womens crying gender social construct accept men dont cry less likely cry troublesome feminist theory occasional men cry ones hurt expectation behave like emotionally typical men note also doesnt talk sadness men feel readily anyone else act crying prove sadness bridge far men,-0.9981,-0.010333333333333328,0.474,reddit,MensRights

However, Toyota and Honda were due to open on Monday in other parts of the country, and Musk wasnt happy about waiting. So he took to Twitter again. All other car companies are allowed to manufacture except Tesla, you knucklehead, he responded to a critic of his previous arrest tweet. gt;He expanded on that false statement with another: Yes, California approved, but an unelected county official illegally overrode. Also, all other auto companies in US are approved to resume. Only Tesla has been singled out. This is super messed up! gt;And then, in yet another tweet: The unelected amp; ignorant interim Health Officer of Alameda is acting contrary to the Governor, the President, our Constitutional freedoms amp; just plain common sense. gt;n reality, the unelected county official is Dr Erica Pan, a specialist in infectious diseases, and she has full authority to block the opening of the factory without an approved public health plan. gt;Musk then retweeted a conspiratorial blog post that claimed the media was purposefully misrepresenting his views, and let his 34 million followers know that in his opinion, Isaac Newton was better than Albert Einstein by a small margin. Both obviously extremely smart for a human, he mused. For a human?? Anyway... gt;California should let Tesla amp; Elon Musk open the plant, NOW. It can be done Fast amp; Safely!, tweeted President of the United States, Donald Trump, on Tuesday morning, sparking a thank you! from Musk several hours later.

If you want to know how to make your villain hateable, take a lesson from the writers working on WWE2K. Starting off, shes a bully back when the story chronologically begins at high school. As a bullying victim myself back when I was in school, I immediately hate her. She assaults Red and dumps ketchup on her face after Tre slips while going to get help which nobody else bothered to do since Brooklyns captain of the wrestling team and had two of the dudes with her, and one of them is literally just blond Rhyno. Fast forward a while and it turns out that the high school gym is being renamed in her honor complete with a mural depicting her as an astronaut, and the Pope, and more while shes just an MMA fighter, and on the night of the reveal she fucks with Reds match to get her to lose, all the while doing commentary via megaphone and trying to get the crowd to cheer for Reds opponent Josie Jane who is actually a decent person. After getting Reds phone number thanks to 2Ks favorite OC, Barron Blade who is now less of a douchenozzle after the events of 2K19s story and didnt know about Red and Brooklyns beef, she continuously harasses her via text through the whole game. After Red and Tre have made it to WWE, Tre decides to fulfill one of his career goals and star in a WWE Studios film, which leads into a Miz feud. Red auditions with him despite not wanting to, and Brooklyn attacks her again, and Red tapping to an ankle lock which happens even after you win the brawl in game is played on international TV. Brooklyn also allowed Miz on set after he failed to get the part so he could attack Tre and take the part back. Later on shes made GM of SmackDown, where Red and Tre have been moved to presumably via the draft. She continues to make their lives miserable, including making a 5v5 series of 1v1 matches with Red, Tre, and The New Day taking on Becky Lynch and her Savages Sheamus, Finn Balor, Pete Dunne, and Drew McIntyre for the SmackDown Womens Championship. Naturally, the last match is Tre vs Drew, after Reds already beaten Becky because that match made it 22. Suddenly, heres Samoa Joe, now a cyborg, literal years after being fired for interfering in Tres Universal title matches, because Joe pulled the Only One Allowed To Defeat You card after Tre won on a fluke. And Brooklyn just wont let Red have a rematch. Fast forward a bit and Tres defending his WWE Championship won from Adam Cole thanks to Joe against Joe, and Brooklyn, after Tre teamed with her in the Mixed Match Challenge is actually coming off as a changed person, offering help to counter the Coquina Clutch. FOOLED YOU! Brooklyns responsible for Joe being back, and she told him about the counter she taught Tre. And because Tre gave her access to his phone, she saw every goal on Red and Tres list, including Reds goal to win the Divas Championship which at the time of the list being made was still around, so let that tell you how long the story spans in universe given it ends at Wrestlemania 2029. So of course, Brooklyn snipes the chance to reintroduce the title. Oh, and the animal shelter she donated to after the MMC, to further convince Tre she changed? She bought it out, and made it a tanning salon. Kicked out all the animals. And the fucking cherry on top: She gained the knowledge that Tres birth parents have been dead for years, long before his wrestling career began. She reveals that Red hid this from him for years, after hed spent years leaving tickets for them at shows hoping to see them, after he sees actors paid to pretend to be his parents, after blackmailing Red with this information forcing her and by domino effect Tre into retirement, ON THE DAY THEY WERE TO GO INTO THE HALL OF FAME. And THEN, she has the fucking gall to team with Joe, and try to steal Red and Tres Hall Of Fame spots in a mixed tag match at Wrestlemania 2029.

The problem with the concept is that the reveal in Westworld is that its all fake, which only has impact if there is a more real world where the actual humans are in danger. After that, you are stuck, because you cant move forward in the old west motif. Its the same reason that Westworld had such creative problems after Season 1; if you invalidate everything in the setting as fake, then none of it really matters, and you have to keep zooming out to make the story engaging. Last season Ill try to avoid WW spoilers they went so big that no western elements even existed anymore, and the show lost a lot of its charm. I do love the idea, but it might kill the franchise.",get youre coming thats really like undead nightmare happens within world rdr remains real problem concept reveal westworld fake impact real world actual humans danger stuck cant move forward old west motif reason westworld creative problems season invalidate everything setting fake none really matters keep zooming make story engaging last season ill try avoid ww spoilers went big western elements even existed anymore show lost lot charm love idea might kill franchise,-0.9753,0.08333333333333333,0.4384259259259259,reddit,gaming

Its much easier to find decent news sources on things like sports, current events, or technology. It gets tricky when it comes to politics though. Some sources are pretty good right up until they start covering politics, then you can see the highly editorialized headlines meant to anger people and generate clicks instead of simply reporting. There are a lot of sites centered around editorials and thats fine, but its not for me personally. Id rather form my own opinion. And they especially turn me off when instead of making a case for their opinion they just try to push hatred of the opposing opinion. To me that is living on fear instead of knowledge.
